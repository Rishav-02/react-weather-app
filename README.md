## Getting Started

First you have to Install **axios**<br>

```bash
npm install axios
```
- **Axios allows you to communicate with the APIs in your React project.**
- **Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.**

Then you need an API key from OpenWeatherMap, you can get one by creating an account on their website.
After you got your API key, copy the line below to the file and replace YOUR_KEY with your OpenWeatherMap API Key.

```
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

<!-- Finally clone this repository, install dependencies and run the local server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/esnz/reactweather.git
``` -->

```bash
cd reactweather
npm install
npm start
```
